#  Proof-of-concept Implementation of: Streamlining CSIDH: Cost-Effective Strategies for Group Actions Evaluation

This C implementation of our work includes code from the [CSI-FiSh library](https://github.com/KULeuven-COSIC/CSI-FiSh) (located in ./csi-fish) that are necessary for key sampling in our initial strategy.

## Prerequisites
Before compiling streamlining lib, you must have the GMP library installed on your system. Follow the instructions below based on your operating system.

### Installing GMP

#### **On Linux:**
- **Debian/Ubuntu:**
  ```bash
  sudo apt-get install libgmp-dev
  ```

- **CentOS/RHEL:**
  ```bash
  sudo yum install gmp-devel
  ```
